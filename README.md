# Simple-Alarm-Clock-with-Arduino
It's an Alarm Clock Code with 4 buttons, and uses a 24 hour format. 

It's not perfect 

-uses a 24 hour format ~while still displaying AM and PM 

-resets everytime it's power is disconnected ( plan to connect rtc sometime )

-need to add comments ( i swear i will do it before december ) 

Anybody is free to use this code.
